        <p>
          The portal enables economists and researchers to seamlessly access integrated datasets, work in personal and collaborative workspaces, and use AI-driven capabilities to analyze, compare, simulate, and enrich data. The goal is to streamline workflows, improve analytical depth, and accelerate research productivity across ERDI while supporting evidence-based policy and engagement with external stakeholders.
